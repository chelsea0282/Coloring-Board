# Color Board 
ECE 3140 Final Project Spring 2018

## Beginning Steps
### Testing TFT
- tested the TFT screen using an Arduino Uno
- tests of testing
  1. show colors on the screen
  2. writ letters on the screen
  3. fill screenw ith color then writing on top
  4. print an image on the screen
     -> had to upload through SD card b/c too large of data
  5. (possibly later) print multiple different images. 
  6. (possibly later) 
  
### SPI connection between TFT and FRDM
- referenced lots of SPI library online to base ours
- found a tutorial PDF for setting up SPI
