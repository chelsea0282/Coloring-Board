timer0 context switching
timer1 real time timer 0.001sec 

process_create --> created stack memory space, put it on the ready queue
process_rt_create --> create stack memory space, deadline


first compare all the deadlines of the processes (as to make the earliest go first)

process select ()

process_t p1 = p2 // copy of p2 and store into p1 (new memory space created)
	access variables p1.sp
process_t*p1 = p2 //makes a copy of the p2's memory address
	access variables p1 ->sp


queue points to the first element in the list bc it's a linked list :(((((((((((((((((((((


x = 3
y = x
x = x+3

deadline is of type realtime_t
so inside realtime.h (realtime.c), I need to make a compare function that will compare the deadlines
